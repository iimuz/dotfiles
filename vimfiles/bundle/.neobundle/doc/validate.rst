.. _\:Validate_scala:

Scala Validation
================

When saving a scala source file that resides in a project, eclim will update
that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation errors found. Any
errors will be placed in the current window's location list (:help
location-list) and the corresponding lines in the source file will be marked
via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>' markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of scala source files can be disabled via the
**g:EclimScalaValidate** variable (described below). If you choose to disable
automatic validation, you can still use the **:Validate** command to manually
validate the current file.

Configuration
-------------

:doc:`Vim Settings </vim/settings>`

.. _g\:EclimScalaValidate:

- **g:EclimScalaValidate** (Default: 1) -
  If set to 0, disables source code validation.

- **g:EclimValidateSortResults** (Default: 'occurrence') -
  If set to 'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
