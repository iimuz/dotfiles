## Creating Pull Requests

Follow these steps when creating pull requests:

1. Check Branch Status

   ```bash
   # Check for uncommitted changes
   git status

   # Check changes
   git diff

   # Check differences from main
   git diff develop...HEAD

   # Check commit history
   git log
   ```

1. Analyze Changes
   - Check all commits since branching from develop
   - Understand the nature and purpose of the changes
   - Evaluate the impact on the project
   - Check for sensitive information
1. Confirm the PR title and description with the user
1. Create Pull Request as Draft

   ```bash
   # Create pull request as draft
   gh pr create --draft --title ":art: Improve error handling with Result type" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
