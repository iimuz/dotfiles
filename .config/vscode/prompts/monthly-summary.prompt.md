## Automation Notes

- When creating the daily summary, first extract all Markdown links (for example: [Title](Link)) from the target file and create a list of referenced files.
- For any referenced files whose content has not yet been retrieved, obtain the content of all such files.
- After retrieving the content of all referenced files, begin generating the summary.
- When generating the summary, reflect the content of referenced files as appropriate, and indicate references using Markdown links as needed.
- Task Extraction Focus: Pay special attention to extracting incomplete tasks by looking for:
  - Verbs indicating future actions (する, やる, 確認, レビュー, 作成, etc.)
  - Questions that need answers (「良いのか?」「必要になりそう」etc.)
  - PR numbers or URLs that need follow-up
  - Meeting outcomes that require action
  - Deadlines or time-sensitive items
- Status Indicators: Look for completion status keywords:
  - Completed: 完了, 終了, 承認した, できた, 済み
  - Ongoing: 進行中, 対応中, レビュー中
  - Planned: 予定, する予定, やる, 明日
  - Blocked: 待ち, 確認が必要, 不明
- Insert the summary as a `## AI Generated Summary` section immediately before the `## Mobile First Daily Interface` section.
- Do not repeat unchanged content; use concise comments or markers as needed.
- No need to link to the base file.
- Always check the content of referenced files and reflect them in the summary and each item as appropriate.
- Use Markdown link format without file extensions, for example: [title](basename).
- Avoid excessive speculation; summarize concisely based on records and links.
- Follow the specified format, length, and style for each item.
