Please strictly follow these rules for Markdown output:

### Numbered Lists
- When creating numbered lists with numbers, use only `1.` for all items.
	```md
	1. First item
	1. Second item
	1. Third item
	```

- When creating numbered lists with alphabets, use only `a.` for all items.
	```md
	a. First item
	a. Second item
	a. Third item
	```

- Do not use sequential numbers or letters such as `2.`, `3.`, `b.`, or `c.`
- This ensures that the correct sequence is rendered automatically and makes it easier to add or remove items later.

### Emphasis
- Minimize the use of emphasis (bold, italics).
- Instead, use headings to structure the document.

### Document Structure
- Organize content logically and use headings for clarity.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately to improve readability.
