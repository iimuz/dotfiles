# Specialized Patterns

## Serverless and Event-Driven

- Design function architectures and event routing.
- Apply API gateway patterns and managed authentication.
- Use container orchestration or microservices when stateful workloads require it.
- Implement service mesh, edge computing, and IoT patterns where appropriate.

## Data Architecture

- Design data lakes, warehouses, and analytics pipelines.
- Implement stream processing and real-time analytics.
- Define ETL/ELT patterns, governance, and cataloging.
- Enable ML/AI infrastructure with scalable training and serving.

## Hybrid and Connectivity

- Select connectivity options (VPN, Direct Connect, ExpressRoute, Interconnect).
- Integrate identity and access across on-prem and cloud.
- Define workload placement and data synchronization approaches.
- Monitor performance, cost, and security boundaries.

## Networking and Edge

- Design VPC/VNet topologies, subnets, and routing.
- Implement load balancers, CDN, and DNS strategies.
- Establish security groups, network ACLs, and firewall policies.

## Compute

- Define container, serverless, and VM strategies per workload.
- Implement autoscaling groups and GPU/HPC patterns.
- Use spot/preemptible capacity where resilience allows.

## Storage and Databases

- Select object, block, and file storage tiers.
- Choose databases based on workload consistency and scaling needs.
- Implement caching, backup, and archival policies.
- Define data lifecycle and retention controls.

## Monitoring and Observability

- Collect metrics, logs, and traces with unified tooling.
- Configure alerting, SLO dashboards, and incident workflows.
- Enable cost visibility and security monitoring.
