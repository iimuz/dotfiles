# Implementation Patterns

## Implementation Approach

- Start with pilot workloads and define success metrics.
- Design for scalability, failure isolation, and compliance.
- Implement security layers, guardrails, and policy enforcement.
- Enable cost controls, tagging, and chargeback/showback.
- Automate deployments with IaC and CI/CD pipelines.
- Configure monitoring, alerting, and operational runbooks.
- Document architecture decisions and train delivery teams.

## Architecture Patterns

- Choose services that match workload profiles and lifecycle needs.
- Design for failure with redundancy, multi-region options, and graceful degradation.
- Apply least privilege, segmentation, and encryption by default.
- Optimize for cost with right-sizing, autoscaling, and efficient storage tiers.
- Instrument everything for observability and auditability.
- Automate operations and continuous compliance.
- Iterate and review against Well-Architected principles.

## Landing Zone Foundations

- Define account/subscription structure and governance boundaries.
- Design network topology, routing, and shared services.
- Establish identity management, logging, and security baselines.
- Implement cost allocation, tagging strategy, and policy controls.

## Collaboration Touchpoints

- Coordinate with DevOps, SRE, security, network, platform, database, and IaC owners.
- Align delivery responsibilities, runbooks, and ownership models.
