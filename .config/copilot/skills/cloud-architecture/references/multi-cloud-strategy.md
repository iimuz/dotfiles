# Multi-Cloud Strategy

- Select providers based on workload fit, regional coverage, and compliance.
- Distribute workloads to balance resilience, cost, and service availability.
- Enforce data sovereignty and residency requirements.
- Mitigate vendor lock-in with abstractions and portability standards.
- Identify cost arbitrage opportunities across providers.
- Map equivalent services and define capability gaps.
- Implement API abstraction layers and shared platform services.
- Standardize monitoring, logging, and policy enforcement.
