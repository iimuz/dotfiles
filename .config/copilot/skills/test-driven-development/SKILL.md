# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** Without watching the test fail, there is no proof it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:**

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

**Exceptions (confirm with the human partner):**

- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

**NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST**

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**

- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## Red-Green-Refactor

```dot
digraph tdd_cycle {
    rankdir=LR;
    red [label="RED\nWrite failing test", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    verify_red [label="Verify fails\ncorrectly", shape=diamond];
    green [label="GREEN\nMinimal code", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];
    verify_green [label="Verify passes\nAll green", shape=diamond];
    refactor [label="REFACTOR\nClean up", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccccff"];
    next [label="Next", shape=ellipse];

    red -> verify_red;
    verify_red -> green [label="yes"];
    verify_red -> red [label="wrong\nfailure"];
    green -> verify_green;
    verify_green -> refactor [label="yes"];
    verify_green -> green [label="no"];
    refactor -> verify_green [label="stay\ngreen"];
    verify_green -> next;
    next -> red;
}
```

### RED - Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

<Good>

```typescript
test("retries failed operations 3 times", async () => {
  let attempts = 0;
  const operation = () => {
    attempts++;
    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error("fail");
    return "success";
  };

  const result = await retryOperation(operation);

  expect(result).toBe("success");
  expect(attempts).toBe(3);
});
```

Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing

</Good>

<Bad>

```typescript
test("retry works", async () => {
  const mock = jest
    .fn()
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("success");
  await retryOperation(mock);
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
});
```

Vague name, tests mock not code

</Bad>

**Requirements:**

- One behavior
- Clear name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

```bash
npm test path/to/test.test.ts
```

Confirm:

- Test fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because feature missing (not typos)

**Test passes?** Test passing immediately indicates existing behavior is already covered. Fix the test.

**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

<Good>

```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (e) {
      if (i === 2) throw e;
    }
  }
  throw new Error("unreachable");
}
```

Just enough to pass

</Good>

<Bad>

```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  options?: {
    maxRetries?: number;
    backoff?: "linear" | "exponential";
    onRetry?: (attempt: number) => void;
  },
): Promise<T> {
  // YAGNI
}
```

Over-engineered

</Bad>

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**

```bash
npm test path/to/test.test.ts
```

Confirm:

- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.

**Other tests fail?** Fix now.

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:

- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next feature.

## Good Tests

| Quality          | Good                                | Bad                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal**      | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |
| **Clear**        | Name describes behavior             | `test('test1')`                                     |
| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API            | Obscures what code should do                        |

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Cannot check all boxes? TDD was skipped. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem                | Solution                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Confirm with the human partner. |
| Test too complicated   | Design too complicated. Simplify interface.                                  |
| Must mock everything   | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection.                                  |
| Test setup huge        | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify design.                             |

## Debugging Integration

Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Test proves fix and prevents regression.

Never fix bugs without a test.

## Reference Materials

When encountering common testing mistakes, consult:

- `references/testing-anti-patterns.md` - Common testing pitfalls and how to avoid them
- `references/examples.md` - Concrete examples of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle

## Final Rule

- Production code → test exists and failed first
- Otherwise → not TDD

No exceptions without the human partner's permission.
