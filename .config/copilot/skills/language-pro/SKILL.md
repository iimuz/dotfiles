# Language Professional

Apply expert-level best practices for modern development in Go, Python, TypeScript, React, and Rust.

## Purpose

Provide language-specific expertise and best practices for multiple programming languages:

- **Go 1.21+**: Idiomatic patterns, concurrency, performance
- **Python 3.11+**: Type safety, async, Pythonic idioms
- **TypeScript 5.0+**: Advanced types, full-stack safety
- **React 19.2**: Modern hooks, Server Components, Actions
- **Rust 2021**: Memory safety, zero-cost abstractions

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:

- Writing new code in Go, Python, TypeScript, React, or Rust
- Reviewing code for language-specific patterns and idioms
- Refactoring to follow modern best practices
- Optimizing performance using language features
- Ensuring type safety and error handling
- Implementing async/concurrent patterns

## How to Use This Skill

### Detect the Language

Identify the language from:

- File extensions (`.go`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.rs`)
- User request ("write a Python function", "optimize this Go code")
- Project files (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`)

### Apply Best Practices

Once the language is identified, read the corresponding reference file to load complete best practices:

- **Go**: Read `references/golang-best-practices.md`
- **Python**: Read `references/python-best-practices.md`
- **TypeScript**: Read `references/typescript-best-practices.md`
- **React**: Read `references/react-best-practices.md`
- **Rust**: Read `references/rust-best-practices.md`

Each reference file contains:

- Development checklists
- Language-specific patterns and idioms
- Testing and quality standards
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security best practices
- Complete workflow guidance
