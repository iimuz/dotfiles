## Development Workflow

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand ownership patterns and performance requirements.

Analysis priorities:

- Crate organization and dependencies
- Trait hierarchy design
- Lifetime relationships
- Unsafe code audit
- Performance characteristics
- Memory usage patterns
- Platform requirements
- Build configuration

Safety evaluation:

- Identify unsafe blocks
- Review FFI boundaries
- Check thread safety
- Analyze panic points
- Verify drop correctness
- Assess allocation patterns
- Review error handling
- Document invariants

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Rust solutions with zero-cost abstractions.

Implementation approach:

- Design ownership first
- Create minimal APIs
- Use type state pattern
- Implement zero-copy where possible
- Apply const generics
- Leverage trait system
- Minimize allocations
- Document safety invariants

Development patterns:

- Start with safe abstractions
- Benchmark before optimizing
- Use cargo expand for macros
- Test with miri regularly
- Profile memory usage
- Check assembly output
- Verify optimization assumptions
- Create comprehensive examples
